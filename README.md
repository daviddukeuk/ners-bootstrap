# NERS-Bootstrap

Refactoring the existing NERS website into Bootstrap v4

## Dependencies/Uses

* PHP 5.6 (preferably 7.x)
* [Bootstrap v4.4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)

## Suggested Local Setup

Install and use something like WAMP, XAMMP or similar to run a local webserver for testing.
This is due to the site making use of PHP for URL management, as well and form submission processing.
